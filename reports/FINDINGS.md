## 📊 Key Findings

### 1. Age Demographics

**Campaign Reach:** The campaign has been more effective for older age groups, with a noticeable dip in effectiveness for younger individuals (18-34), where the purchase rate stands at **37.3%**.

**Purchase Rate by Age Group:** Purchase rates are generally around **40-60%** across all age groups, with the exception of the 18-34 group, indicating that the campaign did not resonate as well with younger audiences.

### 2. Media Exposure

**TV Dominates:** Traditional media, particularly TV, stands out as the most effective media channel with the highest exposure, consistent with the older demographics observed.

**Digital Media:** While YouTube and printed media show relatively similar exposure levels, they are nowhere near TV in terms of reach. Digital media's impact aligns with younger age groups, supporting the observed trend that younger individuals consume more digital content.

**Media Impact on Purchase Rates:** Exposure to media is highly correlated with increased purchase rates. High exposure groups see a significant increase in purchase rates:

- **Low exposure:** ~30% purchase rate
- **High exposure:** ~80% purchase rate

This demonstrates a strong positive correlation between media exposure and conversion.

### 3. Gender and Household Influence

**Gender:** The campaign has achieved nearly equal exposure across men and women, with men showing a slight preference (around **5% more**). This suggests that the campaign is equally appealing and effective for both genders.

**Children in Household:** While households with children represent a small portion of the observations, they do not seem to significantly drive purchases. The purchase rate is roughly **50%** across households with 1 or 2 children, suggesting that having children is not a major factor influencing purchasing decisions.

**Household Size:** Larger households show fewer observations, and there is no significant influence of household size on the purchase rate. The purchase rate remains steady around **50%**, regardless of household size.

## 💡 Recommendations

### 1. Focus on Older Demographics

Since older age groups have shown higher exposure and purchase rates, the next campaign should target this demographic more aggressively.

**Action:** Increase media spend on traditional media, particularly TV, which has proven to be the most effective channel for this group.

### 2. Increase Campaign Reach

The campaign's effectiveness is strongly correlated with exposure.

**Action:** Expand the reach of the campaign, especially in underexposed younger age groups (18-34), which is crucial for driving overall success. Consider increasing the frequency of advertisements or leveraging social media platforms to reach a broader audience.

### 3. Leverage TV and Traditional Media for Older Groups

Since older age groups respond better to traditional media, maintaining or even increasing the investment in TV ads for these segments is recommended.

**Action:** YouTube and other digital channels could supplement the TV strategy, but traditional media should remain the primary channel for this demographic.

### 4. Target Digital Media More Effectively for Younger Groups

For the younger demographic (18-34), digital media, particularly YouTube, can be an effective medium to increase engagement.

**Note:** While digital channels may not drive the highest purchase rates, their cost-effectiveness (due to lack of material costs) and broad reach make them valuable tools for capturing younger audiences.

### 5. Campaign Aggressiveness

To boost purchase rates, especially in groups with low initial exposure, consider intensifying the campaign's reach.

**Action:** Aggressive targeting of high-exposure groups will likely generate a significant increase in conversion rates.

### 6. Gender-Neutral Marketing

The campaign seems to resonate equally with both genders, so continuing with a balanced and gender-neutral approach would be optimal.

**Consideration:** Future campaigns could also explore subtle ways to fine-tune messaging or targeting based on slight preferences across genders.

### 7. Reconsider Child-Focused Messaging

The influence of children in a household appears minimal in driving purchases, so it would be prudent to deprioritize child-centered messaging.

**Action:** Instead, focus on other factors such as age and media consumption habits, which seem to have a greater impact on purchasing behavior.

### 8. Refine Household Size Targeting

With household size showing minimal impact on purchase rates, it's not necessary to tailor marketing strategies around household size.

**Action:** Instead, focus on age group, media exposure, and other sociodemographic features for better targeting.

- Expanding reach to underexposed younger groups
